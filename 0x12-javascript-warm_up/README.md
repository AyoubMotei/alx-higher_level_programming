JavaScript Warm-Up Tasks
This GitHub repository contains a collection of JavaScript warm-up tasks that serve as introductory exercises to JavaScript programming. Each task is designed to help you practice different aspects of JavaScript. Below, you'll find a brief description of each task along with the corresponding code and repository information.

Task 0: First constant, first print
Description:
Write a script that prints "JavaScript is amazing." Create a constant variable called myVar with the value "JavaScript is amazing." Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.

Task 1: 3 languages
Description:
Write a script that prints three lines:

The first line: "C is fun"
The second line: "Python is cool"
The third line: "JavaScript is amazing"
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.
Task 2: Arguments
Description:
Write a script that prints a message depending on the number of arguments passed:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print "No argument."
If only one argument is passed to the script, print "Argument found."
Otherwise, print "Arguments found."
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. Reference: process.arg

Task 3: Value of my argument
Description:
Write a script that prints the first argument passed to it:

If no arguments are passed to the script, print "No argument."
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. Do not use length.

Task 4: Create a sentence
Description:
Write a script that prints two arguments passed to it in the following format: " is "
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.

Task 5: An Integer
Description:
Write a script that prints "My number: " followed by the first argument converted to an integer:

If the argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Not a number."
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. Do not use try/catch.

Task 6: Loop to languages
Description:
Write a script that prints three lines (like Task 1) but by using an array of strings and a loop:

The first line: "C is fun"
The second line: "Python is cool"
The third line: "JavaScript is amazing"
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. Do not use any if/else statement. You can use only one console.log. You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).

Task 7: I love C
Description:
Write a script that prints "C is fun" x times:

Where x is the first argument of the script.
If the first argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Missing number of occurrences."
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. You can use only two console.log. You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).

Task 8: Square
Description:
Write a script that prints a square:

The first argument is the size of the square.
If the first argument can't be converted to an integer, print "Missing size."
Use the character X to print the square.
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var. You must use a loop (while, for, etc.).

Task 9: Add
Description:
Write a script that prints the addition of two integers:

The first argument is the first integer.
The second argument is the second integer.
You have to define a function with this prototype: function add(a, b)
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.
Task 10: Factorial
Description:
Write a script that computes and prints a factorial:

The first argument is an integer (argument can be cast as integer) used for computing the factorial.
Factorial of NaN is 1.
You must do it recursively.
You must use a function.
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.

Task 11: Second biggest!
Description:
Write a script that searches the second biggest integer in the list of arguments:

You can assume all arguments can be converted to integer.
If no argument passed, print 0.
If the number of arguments is 1, print 0.
Use console.log(...) to print all output. Do not use var.

Task 12: Object
Description:
Update this script to replace the value 12 with 89:

Task 13: Add file
Description:
Write a function that returns the addition of 2 integers:

The function must be visible from outside.
The name of the function must be add.
You are not allowed to use var.

Task 14: Const or not const
Description:
Update the script to modify the value of myVar to 333:

Task 15: Call me Moby
Description:
Write a function that executes x times a function:

The function must be visible from outside.
Prototype: function (x, theFunction)
You are not allowed to use var.
Task 16: Add me maybe
Description:
Write a function that increments and calls a function:

The function must be visible from outside.
Prototype: function (number, theFunction)
You are not allowed to use var.
Task 17: Increment object
Description:
Update this script by adding a new function incr that increments the integer value:
