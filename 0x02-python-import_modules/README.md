  <h2>Tasks</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Import a simple function from a simple file</h3>
      <p>
        This task involves writing a program that imports the add function from the file add_0.py and prints the result of the addition 1 + 2 = 3. The program should assign the values 1 and 2 to variables a and b, respectively, and use those variables as arguments when calling the add function. The program should print the result using the format &lt;a value&gt; + &lt;b value&gt; = &lt;add(a, b) value&gt;. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>My first toolbox!</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, a program needs to import functions from the file calculator_1.py, perform mathematical operations, and print the results. The program should assign the values 10 and 5 to variables a and b, respectively, and use those variables as arguments when calling the imported functions. The program should call each imported function and print the results using the format &lt;a&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;b&gt; = &lt;result&gt;. The word calculator_1 should be used only once in the file, and the code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>How to make a script dynamic!</h3>
      <p>
        This task involves writing a program that prints the number of arguments passed to it and lists the arguments themselves. The program should print the number of arguments followed by "argument(s)" or "arguments" and a colon. If there is at least one argument, the program should print each argument on a separate line, with the argument's position and value. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Infinite addition</h3>
      <p>
        This task requires writing a program that prints the result of adding all the arguments passed to it. The program should cast the arguments into integers and calculate their sum. The result should be printed followed by a new line. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Who are you?</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, a program needs to print all the names defined by the compiled module hidden_4.pyc. The program should print one name per line in alphabetical order, excluding names that start with double underscores. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Everything can be imported</h3>
      <p>
        This task involves writing a program that imports the variable a from the file variable_load_5.py and prints its value. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Build my own calculator!</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, a program needs to import all functions from the file calculator_1.py and handle basic operations based on the arguments passed to it. The program should print the result of the operation using the format &lt;a&gt; &lt;operator&gt; &lt;b&gt; = &lt;result&gt;. If the number of arguments is not 3 or if the operator is not one of the supported operators (+, -, *, /), the program should print an error message and exit with a value of 1. The program should cast a and b into integers before performing the operation. The code should not be executed when imported.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Easy print</h3>
      <p>
        This task requires writing a program that prints the string #pythoniscool, followed by a new line, to the standard output. The program should consist of a maximum of 2 lines and should not use the print, eval, open, or import sys statements.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>ByteCode -&gt; Python #3</h3>
      <p>
        In this task, the objective is to write a Python function magic_calculation(a, b) that performs the same operations as the given Python bytecode.
