  <h2>Task Descriptions</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>
      <h3>Run Python File</h3>
      <p>This task involves crafting a shell script that skillfully executes a Python script. The Python file name resides securely in the environment variable $PYFILE. To run this script, execute the 0-run file, which will gracefully initiate the Python script, resulting in the display of the desired output.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Run Inline</h3>
      <p>In this task, a highly effective shell script is meticulously designed to execute Python code. The Python code itself is expertly stored in the environment variable $PYCODE. To execute the script with precision, run the 1-run_inline file. The Python code will be executed flawlessly, and the output will be promptly displayed.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Hello, Print</h3>
      <p>This task entails implementing a Python script that eloquently prints the string "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle," followed by a tasteful newline. To witness this harmonious script in action, execute the 2-print.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Print Integer</h3>
      <p>The primary objective of this task is to artfully complete the given source code, resulting in the printing of an integer securely stored within the variable number. This should be followed by the string "Battery street" and a captivating newline. Experience this enchanting script by running the 3-print_number.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Print Float</h3>
      <p>Within the realm of this task, lies the opportunity to elegantly finalize the source code, ultimately producing the printout of a float stored gracefully within the variable number, with an enchanting precision of two digits. This awe-inspiring script may be brought to life by executing the 4-print_float.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Print String</h3>
      <p>The grand objective of this task is to masterfully conclude the given source code, resulting in the exquisite printing of a string, held tenderly within the variable str, a resplendent three times, followed by the initial nine characters of the same string. Behold the magnificence of this script, devoid of any loops or conditional statements, elegantly contained within a mere five lines. Allow its brilliance to shine through by executing the 5-print_string.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Play with Strings</h3>
      <p>In this task, we embark on a splendid journey through the given source code, ultimately achieving the printing of the captivating string "Welcome to Holberton School!" through the strategic manipulation of the variables str1 and str2. Our script, a masterpiece in its own right, carefully avoids the usage of loops or conditional statements, elegantly distilled into precisely five lines. Experience its charm by executing the 6-concat.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Copy - Cut - Paste</h3>
      <p>The objective of this task is nothing short of brilliance. We are called upon to expertly complete the given source code, skillfully assigning values to three variables (word_first_3, word_last_2, and middle_word), artfully derived from the wondrous contents of the variable word. Our script, an elegant symphony, respectfully adheres to the constraint of eight lines, refraining from any loops or conditional statements. Experience its magnificence by executing the 7-edges.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Create a New Sentence</h3>
      <p>Within the realm of this task, lies the opportunity to expertly finalize the given source code, resulting in the resounding printout of the string "object-oriented programming with Python," delicately followed by a newline. The script, a concise and elegant masterpiece of coding art, gracefully unfolds within precisely five lines, devoid of any loops or conditional statements. Witness its splendor by executing the 8-concat_edges.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Easter Egg</h3>
      <p>In this delightful task, we encounter a Python script of modest length, lovingly created to print "The Zen of Python" by the esteemed Tim Peters. Experience this charming script, gracefully contained within a maximum of 98 characters, by executing the 9-easter_egg.py file.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Linked List Cycle</h3>
      <p>This intriguing task beckons us to construct a remarkable function in C. Our mission is to ascertain if a singly linked list harbors a cycle. The function, aptly named check_cycle, dutifully accepts a pointer to the head of the linked list, confidently returning 0 if no cycle is detected, and 1 if a cycle is indeed present.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Hello, Write</h3>
      <p>This task tasks us with composing a Python script that pens the message "and that piece of art is useful - Dora Korpar, 2015-10-19" to the esteemed standard error stream (stderr) with the aid of the distinguished write function from the illustrious sys module. Furthermore, this script gracefully exits with a status code of 1, leaving an indelible mark on our coding journey.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Compile</h3>
      <p>The allure of this task lies in the creation of an ingenious script, dedicated to the compilation of a Python script file. The Python file name, meticulously stored within the environment variable $PYFILE, elegantly guides the compilation process. The outcome is a compiled output file, adorned with the distinguished extension .pyc, seamlessly appended to the original file name.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>ByteCode -&gt; Python #1</h3>
      <p>In this captivating task, we are presented with the captivating objective of implementing a Python function magic_calculation(a, b). This extraordinary function skillfully undertakes the same computation as the given Python bytecode. The bytecode itself elegantly involves loading a constant value, two fast variables (a and b), performing a binary power operation, and culminating in a bewitching binary add operation. Behold the magic of this function as it gracefully returns the result of this captivating computation.</p>
