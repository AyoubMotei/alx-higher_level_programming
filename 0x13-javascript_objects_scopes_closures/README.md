# JavaScript Objects, Scopes, and Closures

This repository contains JavaScript code that demonstrates various concepts related to objects, scopes, and closures.

## Task 0: Rectangle #0
- Create an empty class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Use the class notation for defining the class.

## Task 1: Rectangle #1
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Use the class notation for defining the class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.

## Task 2: Rectangle #2
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Use the class notation for defining the class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.

## Task 3: Rectangle #3
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Use the class notation for defining the class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character X.

## Task 4: Rectangle #4
- Write a class `Rectangle` that defines a rectangle.
- Use the class notation for defining the class.
- The constructor must take 2 arguments: `w` and `h`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `width` with the value of `w`.
- Initialize the instance attribute `height` with the value of `h`.
- If `w` or `h` is equal to 0 or not a positive integer, create an empty object.
- Create an instance method called `print()` that prints the rectangle using the character X.
- Create an instance method called `rotate()` that exchanges the width and height of the rectangle.
- Create an instance method called `double()` that multiplies the width and height of the rectangle by 2.

## Task 5: Square #0
- Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Rectangle` from Task 4.
- Use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- The constructor must take 1 argument: `size`.
- Call the constructor of `Rectangle` using `super()`.

## Task 6: Square #1
- Write a class `Square` that defines a square and inherits from `Square` from Task 5.
- Use the class notation for defining your class and `extends`.
- Create an instance method called `charPrint(c)` that prints the square using the character `c`.
- If `c` is undefined, use the character X.

## Task 7: Occurrences
- Write a function that returns the number of occurrences of a given element in a list.
- Prototype: `exports.nbOccurences = function (list, searchElement)`.

## Task 8: Esrever
- Write a function that returns the reversed version of a list.
- Prototype: `exports.esrever = function (list)`.
- You are not allowed to use the built-in method `reverse`.

## Task 9: Log me
- Write a function that prints the number of arguments already printed and the new argument value.
- Prototype: `exports.logMe = function (item)`.
- Output format: `<number arguments already printed>: <current argument value>`.

## Task 10: Number conversion
- Write a function that converts a number from base 10 to another base passed as an argument.
- Prototype: `exports.converter = function (base)`.
- You are not allowed to import any file or declare any new variable.

## Task 11: Factor index (Advanced)
- Write a script that imports an array and computes a new array.
- Import the list from the file `100-data.js`.
- Use `map` to create a new list where each value is equal to the value of the initial list multiplied by the index in the list.

## Task 12: Sorted occurrences (Advanced)
- Write a script that imports a dictionary of occurrences by user id and computes a dictionary of user ids by occurrence.
- Import `dict` from the file `101-data.js`.
- Create a new dictionary where a key is the number of occurrences and the value is a list of user ids.

## Task 13: Concat files (Advanced)
- Write a script that concatenates two files.
- The first argument is the file path of the first source file.
- The second argument is the file path of the second source file.
- The third argument is the file path of the destination.
